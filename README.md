FOODit-FrontEndTest
===================

If you’re here it sounds like you’re on your way to becoming a FOODie. Welcome to the FOODit Front End Project. Using our test API’s https://1-dot-endpoints-dot-foodit-uat.appspot.com/ we would like you to build a project using web or native technology.

We have deliberately left this task quite open as we want to let you create something you feel meets the brief as outlined in the section below:

## Goal of the Project
We want to see how you think, code, design and construct functional flows. 
Our goal with the marketplace we are building is to make sure that consumers can find the right meal, based on their taste profile. We know that people have different opinions on food, so we want to build a product that is deeply personalisable, fun, rewarding and educational.  

- Help people find food they are going to enjoy
- Work seamlessly across a range of device resolutions and sizes
- Should allow the user to sort data and filter to create personalised results
- Offer a mix of discovery & ecommerce or focus on one independantly

Some of our ramdom ideas/thoughts/scribbles...
- How could you use meal names, description and price to do a faceted search
- Using the meal name or description look up example photo of the dish using flicker, google image or another service asynchronously
- How would discovery & recommendation vs direct ecommerce ordering work?

Depending on your sill set, pick one of the 3 different ways to build the app

### Building the app with Web technology (requirements)
1. Your project should render the data from the API in a web brower using HTML, CSS and JS
2. Have your source code available on https://github.com/ or https://bitbucket.org so we can review it
3. Have your code hosted and running on a publicly available URL

### Building an iOS Native App (requirements)
1. Your project should render the data from the API in iOS Objective-C
2. Have your source code available on https://github.com/ or https://bitbucket.org so we can review it
3. Distributing to use should be done via TestFlight ( we can send over our iOS UDIDs )

### Building a native Android app (requirements)
1. Your project should render the data from the API natively in Android
2. Have your source code available on https://github.com/ or https://bitbucket.org so we can review it
3. Send over the Andriod APK file to jobs@foodit.com


## Example of working with the API
The FOODit Marketplace API allows you to get demo data about each meal in area. By using the "marketplace.meals.search". Using the Google API Explorer you can have look around some this API’s.

1. Lets start by go to https://1-dot-endpoints-dot-foodit-uat.appspot.com/, our API will redirect to API Explorer.
2. Check out FOODit Marketplace API
3. Go to “marketplace.meals.search”. Put in a Geo location e.g. 51.536215, -0.103181
4. Check out the results of meals
5. You can find SDK for our API's also in github which might help you speed up the development. But the API's very simple so might not be needed.
