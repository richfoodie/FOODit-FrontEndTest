If you’re here it sounds like you’re on your way to becoming a FOODie. Welcome to the FOODit Front End Project. Using our test API’s https://1-dot-endpoints-dot-foodit-uat.appspot.com/ we would like you to build a project using web or native technology.

### What are the Mandatory Requirements for Web
1. Your project you should render the data from the API in a web brower using HTML, CSS and JS
2. Have your source code on open on https://github.com/ or https://bitbucket.org so we can review it
3. Have your code hosted and running on a public URL

### What are the Mandatory Requirements for iOS Native App
1. Your project you should render the data from the API in iOS Objective-C
2. Have your source code on open on https://github.com/ or https://bitbucket.org so we can review it
3. Distributing to use should be done via TestFlight ( we can send over our iOS UDID )

### What are the Mandatory Requirements for Andriod Native App
1. Your project you should render the data from the API in iOS Objective-C
2. Have your source code on open on https://github.com/ or https://bitbucket.org so we can review it
3. Send over the Andriod APK file to jobs@foodit.com

## Goal of the Project
We want to see how you think,  code, design and functional flows. We just want to make sure people can find food that they going to enjoy. We understand that different types of people excel in different ways.   
•	Help people find food going to enjoy
•	Should be responsive to different size device
•	Should allow user to sort data in help full ways
•	Show type of controls or UI patterns
Some of our ideas
•	How could you use meal names, description and price to do a faceted search
•	Using the meal name or description look up example photo of the dish using flicker, google image or another service asynchronously
